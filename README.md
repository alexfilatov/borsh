# Borsh [![Build Status](https://github.com/alexfilatov/borsh/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/alexfilatov/borsh/actions?query=workflow%3ACI) [![Hex pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/borsh.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/borsh) [![hex.pm downloads](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/dt/borsh.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/borsh)

BORSH, binary serializer for security-critical projects.

**IMPORTANT! Implemented only `Serialization`. `Deserialization` will be implemented by the end of the March.**

Borsh stands for `Binary` `Object` `Representation` `Serializer` for `Hashing`. It is meant to be used in
security-critical projects as it prioritizes consistency, safety, speed; and comes with a strict specification.

In short, Borsh is a non self-describing binary serialization format. It is designed to serialize any objects to
canonical and deterministic set of bytes.

General principles:

- integers are little endian;
- sizes of dynamic containers are written before values as u32;
- all unordered containers (hashmap/hashset) are ordered in lexicographic order by key (in tie breaker case on value);
- structs are serialized in the order of fields in the struct;
- enums are serialized with using u8 for the enum ordinal and then storing data inside the enum value (if present).

This is Elixir implementation of the serializer. Official specification: https://github.com/near/borsh#specification

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed by adding `borsh` to your list of
dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:borsh, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

```elixir
  use Borsh,
      schema: [
        signer_id: :string,
        public_key: :borsh,
        nonce: :u64,
        receiver_id: :string,
        block_hash: [32],
        actions: [:borsh]
      ]
```

#### Options

`schema`:
Borsh schema itself, structure of fields for serialisation with serialisation formats.

#### Borsh literal formats

`:string` - String representation of a value. Borsh encodes it as is, with a little-endian 32bit (4 bytes) header of a
string byte size

`:borsh` - Struct of the borsh-ed module. The serializer will take this struct and executes struct's
module `.borsh_encode`
against this struct and assign binary result to the literal.

`[:borsh]` - Enum of borsh-ed structs. Each element of this list of `:borsh` struct must have a Borsh schema

`:u64` - Unsigned integer 64-bit size. There are also `:u8`, `:u16`, `:u32` and `:u128`

`[32]` or `[64]` - A string with 32/64 chars length.
